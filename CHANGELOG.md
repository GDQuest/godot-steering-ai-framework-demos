- Collision avoidance
- Facing
- Path following
- Cohesion and Separation
- Pursuit and seeking
- Fleeing and evading

### Manual

To get started using the framework, check out the framework's [manual](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/godot-steering-toolkit/).

There, you can also find the full [code reference](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/godot-steering-toolkit/reference/).

*Note*: we generate the code reference from docstrings in the source code with [GDScript Docs Maker](https://github.com/GDQuest/gdscript-docs-maker).
