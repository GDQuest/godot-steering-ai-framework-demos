## Introduction

In the 1990s, [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/) developed algorithms for common AI behaviors. They allowed AI agents to seek out or flee from a target, follow a pre-defined path, or face in a particular direction. They were simple, repeatable tasks that could be broken down into programming algorithms, which made them easy to reuse, maintain, combine, and extend.

While an AI agent's next action is based on decision making and planning algorithms, steering behaviors dictate how it will move from one frame to the next. They use available information and calculate where to move at that moment.

Joining these systems together can give sophisticated and graceful movement while also being more efficient than complex pathfinding algorithms like A\*.

## The demos

This project is a collection of demos to showcase and test the Godot Steering AI Framework. See the [framework's repository](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-steering-ai-framework) for more details, inspirations, and functionality, as well as installation instructions to code your own games with the framework.

To run the demos themselves, just open the **project.godot** file under /godot/ and run the project with F5.

## Documentation

The framework's documentation and code reference are both available on the [GDQuest](https://www.gdquest.com/docs/godot-steering-ai-framework/getting-started) website.
